Ester, Coumba, Helena used short person version and that may have lead to increased pressure on the comfort crutch. The position of the sensor may have also affected it.

Later in the experimentation we notice some abnormal results and got Will to test. His results when applying maximum pressure were in the 30s much higher than previous tests. We investigated and noticed the connecting wire to the pressure sensor had sustained damage and the top cover was ripped off. We believe this was the reason for the abnormal results and we will create a stronger sensor.

The sensor has had problems with it breaking during the testing but we were able to get "normal results" after reassembling it. We made sure to keep the amount of Velostat and electrical tape constant however the wire fraying was not a variable we were considering before.
